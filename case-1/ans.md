It looks like you're trying to calculate the average time spent by candidates to complete tasks, grouped by the complexity of the tasks (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`). Your query is almost correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Syntax Errors**: 
   - The `==` operator should be `=` in SQL.
   - The `ORDER BY` clause should come after the `GROUP BY` clause.
   - The `ORDER BY` clause should specify the column to order by, e.g., `ORDER BY T.complexity DESC`.

2. **Calculation of Time Difference**:
   - The difference between `start_time` and `end_time` should be calculated using the appropriate SQL function, depending on the database you're using. For PostgreSQL, you can use the `AGE` function.

3. **Grouping**:
   - You should group by `T.complexity` in the outer query, not in the subquery.

Hereâ€™s the corrected query:

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (TT.endTime - TT.startTime))) AS avg_time_spent, 
    TT.complexity 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        CT.start_time AS startTime, 
        CT.end_time AS endTime, 
        T.complexity AS complexity 
    FROM 
        candidate AS C 
    INNER JOIN 
        candidate_tasks AS CT ON CT.candidate_id = C.id 
    INNER JOIN 
        task AS T ON CT.task_id = T.id 
    LEFT JOIN 
        language AS LL ON LL.id = C.language_id
) AS TT
GROUP BY 
    TT.complexity
ORDER BY 
    TT.complexity DESC;
```

### Explanation:
- **Subquery (`TT`)**: 
  - The subquery selects the `start_time`, `end_time`, and `complexity` for each task completed by a candidate.
- **Outer Query**:
  - The outer query calculates the average time spent (`avg_time_spent`) by candidates to complete tasks, grouped by `complexity`.
  - The `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (TT.endTime - TT.startTime))` function calculates the difference in seconds between `endTime` and `startTime`.
  - The `GROUP BY TT.complexity` groups the results by task complexity.
  - The `ORDER BY TT.complexity DESC` orders the results by complexity in descending order.

This query should give you the average time spent by candidates to complete tasks, grouped by task complexity.
