In Next.js, authentication and authorization can be handled in several ways, depending on the complexity of your application. Here's a breakdown of how these can be approached:

### 1. **Authentication**
Authentication in Next.js is often implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), cookies, or sessions. Common methods include:

#### **a. API Routes with JWT**
- **JWT** can be used for stateless authentication. The server generates a token after successful login, which is stored in the browser (usually in `localStorage` or as an `HttpOnly` cookie). 
- You can create API routes in Next.js to handle login and validation of JWT.
- On the client side, the JWT is sent along with the requests to authenticate the user.

#### **b. NextAuth.js**
- **NextAuth.js** is a popular authentication library that integrates seamlessly with Next.js. It supports multiple authentication providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) and can handle sessions and JWTs automatically.
- You can configure **NextAuth.js** in the `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file to easily set up authentication. It also supports both server-side sessions and JWT-based tokens.

```js
// Example of NextAuth.js configuration
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Providers.Google({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
    // Add other providers as needed
  ],
  session: {
    jwt: true,
  },
  callbacks: {
    async jwt(token, user) {
      if (user) {
        token.id = user.id
        token.email = user.email
      }
      return token
    },
  },
})
```

#### **c. Server-side Authentication with Cookies**
- **Cookies** (often HttpOnly) are commonly used to store session tokens securely. You can use Next.js API routes to handle login and store a cookie with the token.
- When a request is made, the cookie is sent along with the request, allowing the backend to verify the token for authentication.

### 2. **Authorization**
Authorization determines what a user can do once they are authenticated. It is typically handled based on user roles or permissions.

#### **a. Role-based Authorization**
- After authentication, you can fetch the userâ€™s roles from the token or a database and check their permissions.
- In Next.js, you can do this either on the server (using API routes) or client-side (using React context or state management libraries).

#### **b. Server-side Authorization (getServerSideProps)**
- Next.js offers **`getServerSideProps`** for server-side rendering, allowing you to fetch data or check user roles/permissions before rendering a page.
- You can authenticate and authorize the user in **`getServerSideProps`** and redirect them if they don't have the required permissions.

Example of using `getServerSideProps` for authorization:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const token = context.req.cookies.token
  if (!token) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/login',
        permanent: false,
      },
    }
  }

  // Perform authorization check here, e.g., check user role
  const user = decodeToken(token)
  if (user.role !== 'admin') {
    return {
      notFound: true, // or redirect to a "not authorized" page
    }
  }

  return { props: { user } }
}
```

#### **c. Client-side Authorization (React Context or State)**
- For simpler use cases, authorization can be handled directly in the React component by checking user data from the authentication token stored in cookies or the React context.
  
You might use **React Context** to hold the user state and manage permissions across your app.

### 3. **Secure Routes and Redirection**
Next.js allows you to secure pages by checking the authentication status either client-side (using React hooks) or server-side (via `getServerSideProps`). If the user is not authenticated, they can be redirected to the login page.

- **Client-side:** Use state or context to determine if the user is logged in.
- **Server-side:** Use `getServerSideProps` to perform checks before rendering the page.

### Example of protected route with Next.js:

```js
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

const ProtectedPage = () => {
  const { data: session } = useSession()

  if (!session) {
    return <div>Loading...</div> // or a redirect to the login page
  }

  return <div>Protected Content</div>
}

export default ProtectedPage
```

### 4. **Third-party Authentication Providers**
Next.js supports integration with external authentication providers like Google, GitHub, Facebook, and others through libraries like **NextAuth.js** or direct OAuth implementations.

In summary:
- **Authentication** can be handled using JWTs, cookies, or third-party providers like NextAuth.js.
- **Authorization** can be implemented based on user roles, either using server-side or client-side checks.
