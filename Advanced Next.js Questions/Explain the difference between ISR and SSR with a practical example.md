The main difference between **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** and **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** lies in **how the page content is generated** and **how often it gets updated**. Both approaches provide server-rendered pages, but they handle caching and regeneration differently.

Here’s a breakdown of their differences and a practical example to illustrate each.

---

### **1. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

**ISR** allows you to update static content after the site has been built and deployed without having to rebuild the entire site. With ISR, pages are **generated at build time** and served as static HTML. When a page becomes stale (after a specified period), it is regenerated in the background for the next user while still serving the previous cached version.

- **When does regeneration happen?** Regeneration happens **periodically** after the specified `revalidate` time.
- **Cache behavior:** Once the page is generated, it’s cached and served to users until it becomes stale (based on the `revalidate` interval).

#### **ISR Workflow**:

1. **Initial Request**: Page is generated at build time.
2. **Subsequent Requests**: The page is served from the cache.
3. **After `revalidate` time**: Next request triggers background regeneration. The user sees the old cached page until the new page is ready.

#### **Practical Example of ISR**:

Imagine a blog with dynamic content (e.g., posts, comments). You want the homepage to display recent posts, but you don't want to regenerate the entire homepage on every request. Instead, you want it to regenerate every 60 seconds.

```js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const recentPosts = await fetchRecentPosts();

  return {
    props: { posts: recentPosts },
    revalidate: 60,  // Regenerate page every 60 seconds
  };
}
```

- On **first visit**, the page is generated and cached at the edge.
- On **subsequent visits** (within 60 seconds), the cached page is served.
- After **60 seconds**, the page is considered stale. On the next request, the cached page is served, but in the background, Next.js regenerates the page.
- The next visitor after regeneration sees the updated page.

### **2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

**SSR** generates the page **on every request**. It fetches the data at the time the page is requested, and the page is rendered dynamically on the server, then sent to the client. This ensures the content is always up-to-date, but it may introduce more load on the server since each request triggers the page generation.

- **When does regeneration happen?** The page is generated on every **request**.
- **Cache behavior:** No caching by default; the page is generated fresh each time a request is made.

#### **SSR Workflow**:

1. **Initial Request**: The page is generated on the server, with fresh data, and sent to the user.
2. **Subsequent Requests**: The page is re-generated on the server every time it's requested.

#### **Practical Example of SSR**:

Imagine a product page where you need to show **real-time stock availability**. Since the stock data may change frequently, you need to fetch it from the server every time the page is requested.

```js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const stockData = await fetchStockData();

  return {
    props: { stock: stockData },
  };
}
```

- On **every request**, the page will be rendered on the server, and the **fresh stock data** will be fetched.
- No caching happens, and the page is always up-to-date.

### **Differences between ISR and SSR**

| **Feature**                  | **ISR**                            | **SSR**                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Rendering Time**            | Generated at build time, then revalidated at intervals. | Generated on every request.      |
| **Caching**                   | Cached at the CDN for fast access, with periodic regeneration. | No caching by default; always generates fresh content. |
| **Revalidation**              | Allows background regeneration after a specific period (e.g., 60 seconds). | No regeneration period; the page is always freshly rendered on each request. |
| **Use Case**                  | Ideal for pages with content that doesn’t change very frequently but needs to be updated periodically. | Ideal for pages where content changes on every request (e.g., user-specific data, real-time information). |
| **Performance Impact**        | Better performance since pages are cached. | Potential performance hit since the page is regenerated on each request. |
| **Example Use Case**          | Blog homepage, product listing, news site where content updates periodically. | Dynamic pages like product details with real-time stock availability, user profile pages with personal data. |

### **Practical Example Comparison**

#### **Scenario 1: Blog Page (ISR)**
- The blog's homepage displays a list of recent posts. New posts are added regularly, but the homepage doesn’t need to update every second. You want to regenerate the page every 60 seconds to keep it reasonably up-to-date.
  
```js
// ISR: Regenerate the page every 60 seconds
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const recentPosts = await fetchRecentPosts();
  
  return {
    props: { posts: recentPosts },
    revalidate: 60,  // Regenerate page every 60 seconds
  };
}
```

#### **Scenario 2: Real-Time Stock Page (SSR)**
- A product page where the stock count changes frequently. You need the page to be generated fresh on each request to show the latest stock count.
  
```js
// SSR: Always fetch fresh data on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const stockData = await fetchStockData();

  return {
    props: { stock: stockData },
  };
}
```

### **Summary of When to Use ISR vs SSR**

- **Use ISR** when:
  - Content is updated periodically, but you don’t need the page to be refreshed with every request.
  - You want to combine the performance benefits of static generation with the ability to update the content.
  - Your content can tolerate some staleness between updates.

- **Use SSR** when:
  - Content is dynamic and needs to be updated on every request.
  - Real-time data, user-specific content, or frequently changing content is required.
  - You want to serve the most up-to-date information without delay.

Both **ISR** and **SSR** can be used in Next.js depending on the need for real-time data versus performance optimization, and they can also be mixed within the same application.
