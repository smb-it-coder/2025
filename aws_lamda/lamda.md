Here are some AWS Lambda interview questions that cover a range of topics from basic to advanced:

### Basic Questions:
1. **What is AWS Lambda?**
   - AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.

2. **How does AWS Lambda work?**
   - AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

3. **What programming languages does AWS Lambda support?**
   - AWS Lambda supports multiple programming languages including Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, and PowerShell.

4. **What is the maximum execution duration for an AWS Lambda function?**
   - The maximum execution duration for an AWS Lambda function is 15 minutes.

5. **How do you deploy code to AWS Lambda?**
   - You can deploy code to AWS Lambda by uploading a ZIP file or a container image, or by using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.

### Intermediate Questions:
1. **What are Lambda function handlers?**
   - A Lambda function handler is the method in your function code that processes events. When you invoke a function, Lambda runs the handler method.

2. **How do you manage dependencies in AWS Lambda?**
   - You can manage dependencies by including them in the deployment package (ZIP file) or by using Lambda layers.

3. **What are Lambda layers?**
   - Lambda layers are a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, or other function dependencies. They allow you to manage and share code across multiple functions.

4. **How do you monitor AWS Lambda functions?**
   - You can monitor AWS Lambda functions using Amazon CloudWatch, which provides logs and metrics such as invocation count, duration, and error rates.

5. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation in AWS Lambda?**
   - Synchronous invocation waits for the function to complete and returns the result, while asynchronous invocation queues the event for processing and returns immediately.

### Advanced Questions:
1. **How do you handle errors and retries in AWS Lambda?**
   - You can handle errors by using try-catch blocks in your code. For asynchronous invocations, Lambda automatically retries failed invocations. You can also configure Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) to capture failed events.

2. **What is AWS Lambda@Edge?**
   - AWS Lambda@Edge allows you to run Lambda functions in response to CloudFront events, enabling you to customize content delivery at the edge locations.

3. **How do you optimize the performance of AWS Lambda functions?**
   - You can optimize performance by increasing memory allocation (which also increases CPU power), minimizing the deployment package size, using provisioned concurrency, and optimizing your code.

4. **What is provisioned concurrency in AWS Lambda?**
   - Provisioned concurrency keeps a specified number of function instances initialized and ready to handle requests, reducing latency for critical applications.

5. **How do you secure AWS Lambda functions?**
   - You can secure AWS Lambda functions by using IAM roles and policies, enabling VPC for network isolation, encrypting environment variables, and using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

### Scenario-Based Questions:
1. **How would you design a serverless application using AWS Lambda?**
   - Discuss the use of Lambda in conjunction with other AWS services like API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and SNS/SQS to build a scalable and cost-effective serverless application.

2. **How would you handle a sudden spike in traffic with AWS Lambda?**
   - Explain how Lambda automatically scales to handle increased traffic and how you can use provisioned concurrency to ensure low latency during traffic spikes.

3. **What would you do if your Lambda function is timing out?**
   - Investigate the cause of the timeout, which could be due to long-running processes, network latency, or resource constraints. Consider optimizing the code, increasing the timeout setting, or breaking the function into smaller parts.

4. **How would you debug a Lambda function that is not working as expected?**
   - Use CloudWatch logs to review the function's execution logs, check for errors, and use AWS X-Ray for tracing and identifying performance bottlenecks.

5. **How would you integrate AWS Lambda with a relational database?**
   - Discuss using AWS RDS Proxy to manage database connections efficiently, or using a VPC to securely connect Lambda to an RDS instance.

These questions should help you prepare for an AWS Lambda interview by covering a broad range of topics from basic concepts to advanced scenarios.
