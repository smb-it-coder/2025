Given your extensive IT experience, you likely have a strong foundation in programming concepts, which will help you learn Python and Django quickly. Below is a structured 2-day plan to cover the major basics of Python, followed by a roadmap to dive into Django.

---

### **Day 1: Python Basics**
Focus on core Python concepts and syntax. Since you have experience, you can move quickly through the basics.

#### **Morning Session (4 hours)**
1. **Python Setup and Basics**
   - Install Python and set up your environment (VS Code, PyCharm, or any IDE).
   - Run a simple "Hello, World!" program.
   - Understand Python's syntax (indentation, comments, etc.).

2. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Variables, dynamic typing, and naming conventions.
   - Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`.
   - Type conversion and type checking.

3. **Operators and Expressions**
   - Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
   - Membership and identity operators (`in`, `is`).

4. **Control Flow**
   - Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `else` in loops.

#### **Afternoon Session (4 hours)**
5. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Parameters, arguments, and return values.
   - Lambda functions and scope (local vs global).

6. **Data Structures**
   - Lists: indexing, slicing, methods (`append`, `remove`, etc.).
   - Tuples: immutability and use cases.
   - Dictionaries: key-value pairs, methods (`keys`, `values`, `items`).
   - Sets: uniqueness and operations.

7. **File Handling**
   - Reading and writing files (`open`, `read`, `write`, `close`).
   - Using `with` for file handling.

### **Day 2: Intermediate Python and Django Prep**
Focus on more advanced Python topics and prepare for Django.

#### **Morning Session (4 hours)**
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Attributes, methods, and `self`.
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
   - Special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.).

2. **Modules and Packages**
   - Importing modules (`import`, `from ... import`).
   - Creating and using custom modules.
   - Standard library overview (`os`, `sys`, `math`, `datetime`, etc.).

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try-except blocks.
   - Handling specific exceptions.
   - Using `finally` and `else`.

4. **Working with Libraries**
   - Install and use third-party libraries using `pip`.
   - Examples: `requests`, `numpy`, `pandas`.

#### **Afternoon Session (4 hours)**
5. **Introduction to Django**
   - What is Django? (MVC/MVT architecture).
   - Setting up Django: `pip install django`, `django-admin startproject`.
   - Understanding the project structure (`settings.py`, `urls.py`, `wsgi.py`, etc.).

6. **Creating a Simple Django App**
   - Create an app: `python manage.py startapp myapp`.
   - Define models, views, and URLs.
   - Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.

7. **Django Basics**
   - Models: Define database tables using Python classes.
   - Views: Write functions or classes to handle requests.
   - Templates: Render HTML using Django's template language.
   - URLs: Map URLs to views using `urls.py`.

### **Next Steps After 2 Days**
Once youâ€™ve covered the basics, you can dive deeper into Django:
1. **Django Models and Database**
   - Learn about migrations (`makemigrations`, `migrate`).
   - Understand relationships (one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many).

2. **Django Forms**
   - Create and validate forms.
   - Handle form submissions.

3. **Django Admin**
   - Customize the Django admin interface.
   - Register models to the admin panel.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement user registration, login, and logout.
   - Use Django's built-in authentication system.

5. **Deployment**
   - Learn how to deploy a Django app (e.g., using Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).

### **Tips for Fast Learning**
- **Practice**: Write code for every concept you learn.
- **Projects**: Build small projects (e.g., a to-do app, blog, or weather app).
- **Documentation**: Refer to the official Python and Django documentation.
- **Cheat Sheets**: Use Python and Django cheat sheets for quick reference.

With your IT experience, you should be able to grasp these concepts quickly and start building Django applications in no time!
