**Interview Question:**  
*Design a scalable RESTful API for an eCommerce platform using Node.js. The API should handle product inventory management, order processing, and user authentication. How would you ensure the system can handle high traffic during flash sales, prevent overselling of limited stock, and maintain data consistency?*

**Follow-Up Points to Assess:**  
1. **Architecture & Scalability**:  
   - How would you structure the backend (e.g., microservices vs. monolithic)?  
   - What tools (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) or strategies (e.g., caching, load balancing) would you use to handle spikes in traffic?  

2. **Inventory Management**:  
   - How do you prevent race conditions when multiple users purchase the same product simultaneously?  
   - Would you use database transactions (e.g., with Sequelize/Mongoose) or an external system (e.g., Redis for atomic operations)?  

3. **Order Processing**:  
   - How would you design idempotent APIs to avoid duplicate orders?  
   - How might you integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and handle failures?  

4. **Security**:  
   - How would you secure user data (e.g., JWT, HTTPS, encryption)?  
   - What measures would you take to prevent fraud (e.g., rate limiting, CAPTCHA)?  

5. **Database Design**:  
   - What database (SQL vs. NoSQL) would you choose and why?  
   - How would you structure schemas for products, orders, and users?  

**Sample Answer Expectations:**  
- **Redis for Caching**: Cache product details to reduce database load during high traffic.  
- **Atomic Operations**: Use Redis or PostgreSQL’s `SELECT FOR UPDATE` to lock inventory checks.  
- **Message Queues**: Implement RabbitMQ/Kafka to decouple order processing and handle asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending confirmation emails).  
- **Database Transactions**: Ensure inventory deduction and order creation happen atomically.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Use Express middleware like `express-rate-limit` to prevent abuse.  
- **JWT/OAuth2**: For secure user authentication and stateless sessions.  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Docker/Kubernetes to auto-scale Node.js instances behind a load balancer.  

This question evaluates the candidate’s ability to balance performance, security, and reliability in a real-world eCommerce system.
