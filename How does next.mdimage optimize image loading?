`next/image`, a built-in component in Next.js, optimizes image loading through several key strategies:

### 1. **Automatic Image Optimization**  
   - Next.js optimizes images at build time or on-demand based on request parameters.
   - Uses modern image formats like **WebP** or **AVIF** when supported.

### 2. **Lazy Loading**  
   - By default, images are **lazy-loaded**, meaning they only load when they enter the viewport, reducing initial page load time.

### 3. **Responsive Images**  
   - Generates multiple versions of an image at different resolutions.
   - The `<img>` tag's `srcset` ensures the browser loads the best-suited size.

### 4. **On-Demand Image Resizing**  
   - Images are resized dynamically using the Next.js image optimization API.
   - Only the required image size is served, reducing unnecessary bandwidth usage.

### 5. **Automatic Caching**  
   - Optimized images are cached for better performance.
   - Next.js stores optimized images in a cache directory, avoiding redundant processing.

### 6. **CDN Support**  
   - Works seamlessly with **Vercelâ€™s Image Optimization API**.
   - Can be configured to serve images from external CDNs for faster delivery.

### 7. **Blur Placeholder & Loading Effect**  
   - Supports a low-quality image placeholder (`blurDataURL`) for a smooth transition.
   - Prevents layout shifts by reserving space before the image loads.

### 8. **Built-in Support for Remote Images**  
   - Next.js allows remote images from external sources with a configuration in `next.config.js` (`images.domains`).

### Example Usage:
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Image 
      src="/example.jpg" 
      alt="Example Image"
      width={500} 
      height={300} 
      priority // Loads immediately (e.g., for above-the-fold images)
      placeholder="blur" // Blurred placeholder effect
    />
  );
}
```
