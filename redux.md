### **What is Redux, and why is it used?**  
Redux is a **state management library** for JavaScript applications, commonly used with **React, Angular, and other frameworks**. It provides a **predictable state container** that helps manage the application state efficiently, especially in **large-scale applications**.  

#### **Why is Redux used?**  
1. **Centralized State Management** â€“ The entire application state is stored in a **single source of truth (store)**, making state management more predictable.  
2. **Predictability** â€“ State updates follow a strict **unidirectional data flow**, making debugging easier.  
3. **Efficient State Updates** â€“ Redux efficiently updates components by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.  
4. **Time Travel Debugging** â€“ Since state changes are recorded as immutable objects, it allows developers to track and replay state transitions.  
5. **Scalability** â€“ Helps manage state in large applications by avoiding **prop drilling** and **complex component communication**.

### **What are the core principles of Redux?**  
Redux follows three fundamental principles:  

1. **Single Source of Truth**  
   - The entire application's state is stored in a **single JavaScript object (store)**, ensuring consistency.  

2. **State is Read-Only**  
   - The state cannot be modified directly. Changes are made through **dispatching actions**, ensuring **pure function-based updates**.  

3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions (Reducers)**  
   - The state transitions are handled by **reducers**, which are pure functions that take the previous state and an action to return a new state.

### **Explain the Redux Workflow**  
Redux follows a strict unidirectional data flow:  

1. **Action is Dispatched** â€“ The application **dispatches an action** (an object describing the event).  
2. **Reducer Processes the Action** â€“ The reducer takes the **previous state** and the **action** and returns a **new state**.  
3. **State is Updated in the Store** â€“ The new state is stored in the **Redux store**.  
4. **UI Re-renders** â€“ Components subscribed to the store get the updated state and re-render accordingly.  

#### **Redux Data Flow Diagram:**  
```plaintext
Component â†’ Dispatch Action â†’ Reducer â†’ Store (Updates State) â†’ UI Rerenders
```

### **What are Actions in Redux?**  
Actions are **plain JavaScript objects** that describe **what should happen** in an application. They **send data** from the UI to the Redux store.  

#### **Example of an Action:**  
```javascript
const addUser = (user) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_USER',
    payload: user
  };
};
```
- `type` â€“ Describes the type of action.  
- `payload` â€“ Holds the data that needs to be updated in the store.  

Actions are dispatched using `dispatch(action)`.

### **What is a Reducer in Redux?**  
A reducer is a **pure function** that takes the **current state** and an **action** and returns a **new state**.  

#### **Example of a Reducer:**  
```javascript
const userReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_USER':
      return [...state, action.payload]; // Returns a new state
    default:
      return state; // Returns the unchanged state
  }
};
```
- Reducers must be **pure functions** (no side effects).  
- They **should not mutate the state** but return a new object.  

---

### **What is the Role of the Store in Redux?**  
The **store** is the central hub of Redux, holding the entire application state.  

#### **Responsibilities of the Store:**  
1. Holds the **application state**.  
2. Allows **state access** via `store.getState()`.  
3. Allows **state updates** via `store.dispatch(action)`.  
4. Registers listeners with `store.subscribe(listener)`.  

#### **Creating a Redux Store:**  
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import userReducer from './reducers/userReducer';

const store = createStore(userReducer);
```
- The store is created using the **`createStore`** function with a reducer.
